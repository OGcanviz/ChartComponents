# Chart Properties

In the [Quick Start](/), you learned how to update some of the chart component properties and how to create and customize a Pie chart.

In this guide, you will learn more details about the properties you can use to configure the charts.

### Type

The Type property determines the kind of chart to display. We have implemented the following types of charts so far.  Would you like to add another to the library?  That would be awesome!  Please send us a Pull Request!

* Pie
* Solid Gauge
* Funnel
* Line
* Bar
* Radar
* Scatter
* Candle

> **Note**: The Gantt chart uses different data payload schema and we created a separate component for it.  [Learn more and create a](gantt.md) Gannt chart.  

### Colors

The property accepts a series of colors:

```javascript
["#31825d", "#30a667", "#5ec16c", "#f6c790", "#f7c772", "#f7b45b", "#f68f64", "#d46068", "#946eb0", "#769acc", "#60c5ea"]
```

They are used by the various labels and legends. 

[All CSS color values](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp) are allowed. For examples: `Blue`, `#808080`. 

> **Note**: This also applies to other color fields, such as title color, line color, etc.

### Title

### Data

Legends, labels and values are set via this property. Below is sample data for radar chart.  The data, just like all the properties, may be passed in dynamically at run time.

```javascript
{
    legends: ["Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3"],
    labels: ["Label 1",  "Label 2",  "Label 3",  "Label 4",  "Label 5",  "Label 6",  "Label 7",  "Label 8"],
    table: Table(
        { key:"1.y", values: [500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500] },
        { key:"2.y", values: [400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400] },
        { key:"3.y", values: [300, 300, 300, 300, 300, 300, 300, 310] }
    )
}
```

> **Known Issue**: 
> By default, the Canviz Power Apps Chart Components support a maximum of 100 points. If you wish to modify the code to support more points, for example 400, then add the following record to a charts Options property:
>
> ```javascript
> { key: "indexes", value: "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20" }
> ```
>
> The value contains 20 continuous numbers starting at 1, and separated by commas. 20 Ã— 20 = 400
