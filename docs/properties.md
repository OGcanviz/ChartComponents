| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Pie         | TODO: add some image here? |
| Solid Gauge |                            |

| Line        |                            |
| Bar         |                            |
| Radar       |                            |

| Candle      |                            |

> **Note**: Gantt chart uses different data payload. We created a separated component for it. Please check [gantt](gantt.md).  

### Colors

The property contains a series of colors:

```json

They will be used by different labels or legends.
