To make a Pie chart, enter Pie in the Type property.  Pie is the default Type property.
* **Type**: Pie

To change the size of the chart, click the Advanced tab and change the Height and Width properties.
* **Size**: 360 Ã— 360

* **Title**: To change the Title, edit the Title property.  The Title property is a record property.  Edit the value in the formula bar.  Update the value for the text field in the Title property to "Favorite Types of Movies".

* **Subtitle**: The Subtitle is also a record property. Set its text field to empty to hide it.

  ```javascript
  {
      text: "",
      ...
  }
  ```
* **Options**: Options allow you to configure the look and feel of the chart to a large degree.  For example, to change the size of the inner radius for the pie chart, simply set the pie.InnerRadius property.  Update the Options property with the following code.  For more details about the various options properties, please see the dcoumentation page for each chart.

  ```javascript
  Table(
      { key:"pie.innerRadius", value:"0.7" }
  )
  ```

* **Data**: Just like the name says, this property contains the data the chart renders.  Update the Daata property with the following code.  Keep in mind, this property can be set at runtime so you can make these charts dynamic.

  ```javascript
  {
      labels: ["Comedy","Action","Romance", "Drama"],
      table: Table(
          { key:"values", values: [4, 5, 6, 1] }
      )
  }
  ```

Now take a look at your chart!
