# Canviz Power Apps Chart Components

We created these chart components to supplement and enhance the out of the box charting controls Power Apps comes with.  We hope you enjoy using them in your own Power Apps solutions.

We encourage and welcome community contributions!  Please submit a Pull Request if you have a new chart to add or enhancements to the existing charts.

## Charts

The Canviz Power Apps Chart Components allow you to create several types of charts.

- Pie
- Solid Gauge
- Funnel
- Line
- Bar
- Radar
- Scatter
- Candle Stick
- Gantt - **Yes, a Gantt chart too!**

## How It Works

Essentially, you add the Canviz Power Apps Chart Components to your Power App then set the properties on the components to specify the data they display and how they look and feel.  That's it.  Done!

The chart components evaluate the properties and render the appropriate SVG code to create the charts.  Simple, lightweight, fast, and effective.
